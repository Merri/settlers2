These tables cover base concepts of buildings in the game.

## Construction resource buildings

These are the very foundation of your economy as building bigger buildings requires both boards and stones. Granite is a limited resource!

## Food resource buildings

You will eventually run out of fish and wild animals. Grain and water, and thus bread and ham are endless resources.

## Mineral resource buildings

Metalworks produces tools randomly based on tool priorities. The tools window can be opened from Main selection window. Minerals are a limited resource!

## Storage and transportation buildings

Donkeys double the rate merchandise travels on road (flag-to-flag), however on expedition mission maps donkeys behave buggily and get transported all the time from one harbor to another. Avoid donkeys when building ships.

Transportation times increase if you don't build storehouses.
