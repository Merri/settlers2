A new stable release is out! As of right now the main RttR site does not have the download, but you can find download links in the <Link href="http://rttr.info/index.php?com=forum&mod=forum&action=thread&id=1043&start=-1">announcement news post</Link>.

Main changes include:

-   Greatly improved AI player
-   A lot of bugs fixed
-   And even more bugs fixed
-   Speed improvements
-   Observation windows

There are many other changes as well, but listing (or remembering) all of them is quite a task!
