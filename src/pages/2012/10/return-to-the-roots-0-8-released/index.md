A new stable release is out! As of right now the main RttR site does not have the download, but you can find download links in the [announcement news post](http://rttr.info/index.php?com=forum&mod=forum&action=thread&id=1043&start=-1).

Main changes include:

- Greatly improved AI player
- A lot of bugs fixed
- And even more bugs fixed
- Speed improvements
- Observation windows

There are many other changes as well, but listing (or remembering) all of them is quite a task!
