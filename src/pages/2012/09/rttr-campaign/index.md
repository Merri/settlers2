I put some thoughts for creating a [Return to the Roots Campaign](http://www.rttr.info/index.php?com=forum&mod=forum&action=thread&id=1032). The first five missions would be made to work on original game so there would be things to do that can be experienced. There is no campaign support in RttR at the moment.

One idea that I forgot to put on that forum post is that I'd like to see a mission which has multiple goals and where player could end up playing just one of three possible next missions. So there wouldn't just be 10 missions but instead the player would end up playing a different path. This would give more value to the player as there could be multiple endings. Maybe the player could choose from being good or evil by his actions in the missions...
