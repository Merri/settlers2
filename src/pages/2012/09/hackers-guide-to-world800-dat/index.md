To make it easier for everyone to have a look at these files I've now compiled all WORLD800.DAT files from the demo versions of the game into something that is easier to work with!

The zip file below provides a PNG image that visually shows the raw contents of a savegame map file. The accompanying RAW file is that same data as a pure hex dump.

There are three map files included: demo v0.16 map, demo v1.02 map and demo v1.51 map (aka "Cold Times").
