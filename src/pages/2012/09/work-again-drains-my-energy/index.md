So the effects of summer holidays have worn off: I'mÂ back to having busy days at work, so busy that I'm tired when I'm on my free time. This includes weekends which are largely spent resting. Unlike last year and year before that I'm not taking any pressure. I know I'll have some easier time sooner or later. I'm also learning to going bed early. I don't know when I get my first week that I've slept properly each day, but eventually it happens. I hope the cumulative effect of having enough sleep also means I have more energy, enough to do programming during my free time.

In the meanwhile you'll get these random minor updates like the YouTube one or new replacement buildings.
