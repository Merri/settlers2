There are high quality recordings of original songs ripped from MIDI playback. The exceptions:Â Song 1 is ripped in SoundBlaster AWE32 MIDI Syntherizer, while Song 8 is ripped in SoundBlaster 16 FM OPL-3 MIDI Syntherizer. These "retro" versions had a better instrument balance than other syntherizers.
