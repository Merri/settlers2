I went through the users list and removed any account that seemed like a spam account. I hope I didn't remove any accounts of a real user. If that happened I apologize, and you're free to create a new account.

On the other news I found more information on how to implement a binary upload and download in AJAX, but there may be some nasty browser limitations involved. I'll look into it in a better time as I'm having quite an uncomfortable day today as it is painful to eat or drink anything and my head is sore. Yeah, some sort of flu disease that slowly caused an aphthous ulcer (or canker sore) in a very very bad place in my mouth. Luckily the flu itself hasn't gotten much done, only had some throat issues early last week, and again some this week. I'm not sick often so diseases tend to be quite mild on me.
