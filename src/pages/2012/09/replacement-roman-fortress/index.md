A continuation of replacement Roman graphics for Return to the Roots. This new version of the Fortress addresses the issue of the door being too small as well as fixes some of the building proportions to be bigger and more fit for the game. Instead of looking like a miniature it looks more "cartoon-like" just like the buildings in original game.
