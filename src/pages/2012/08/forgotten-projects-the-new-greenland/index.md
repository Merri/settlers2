So while I was working with the [new tools page](/tools/) earlier today I also ended up having another look at my yet-to-be-released final version of the New Greenland texture. And alongside that I had a few map files that I checked out. And then I wanted to make the first map based on the New Greenland texture, a map that actually would make use of the new textures that have previously gone unnoticed and unused.

Here you have a nasty sneak peek of what I have on my mind...
