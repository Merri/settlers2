I'm not kidding here! This guy walked on water!

He first couldn't decide whether to leave the HQ or not, walking to the flag pole and back to the HQ a few times, until he finally decided he is truly a miraculous one and took the route over water. My guess? The original game allows walking on water in case pathfinding fails. I'm not sure why it failed... maybe it is the coastal flag pole, maybe it is the swamp, maybe it is the water route... maybe all of those together. In any case it is possible to see your people walking on water and you truly know in this game you are a god!
