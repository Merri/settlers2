As the Map Database part of Online Editor isn't going to be finished very soon I made it very easy to upload maps: just upload a map and it'll appear for everyone. At the moment any one person can have up to 15 maps in the service.

Update!

Just hit the Maps link at the bottom right corner of the top banner to find it. Decided it is clearer than "online editor" which really isn't much of an editor at the moment.
