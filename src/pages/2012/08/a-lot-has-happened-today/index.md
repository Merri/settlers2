Is it enough just to say that a lot has happened? I guess not. There is a plenty of updates on existing documentation pages and today has been a very chatty day in the comments (as you can see). We also have a new page: [landscape objects table](/documentation/objects-landscape-table/). Yes, it has all the decorative objects supported with graphical image. The table isn't complete in the sense that it doesn't go up to 255 that is the maximum object ID, but there really isn't anything interesting up there. Just a lot of values that'll cause you crashes if you're trying to deal with mission object graphics. Regular objects are just empty after object ID 0x2B (43).
