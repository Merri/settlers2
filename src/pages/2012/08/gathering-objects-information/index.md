I started a new [page purely about objects](/documentation/objects/ "Objects"). The map file page would have started to become far too long if all the object details would've been added in so I thought it was better to start a fresh new page. Thanks to Spike for giving a little bit of new information as a push to get me started on investigating more!

**Update!**

Oh, see all the glitchy trees animating... without animation, but you get the idea. Each row has one tree, and as it is "animated" things go left. The leftmost comes again to become the rightmost.
