## Original soundtrack playlist

Here are the game's songs as composed by Haiko Ruttmann.

Note: the first song appears to have a bug in YouTube and does not play immediately. Hit the settings icon in the bottom
and change video quality to 720p or 360p and it should play it fine. 480p seems to not work and YouTube embed seems to
try loading that by default. I have not found a working workaround for that.
