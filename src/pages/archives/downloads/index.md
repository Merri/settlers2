Apparently there is no German demo archives available, only English language demos, excluding the "erste demo" that is more of a preview or beta release than a true demo.

## Making the above a full game

It is possible to use the files provided above to make a virtually full copy of the game; or use the files for playing Return to the Roots. You'll miss a few things like all the fan made maps provided with the Gold Edition, but essentially mixing the files and using the latest version when there is a conflict will result into a full game, including the Map Editor. I won't give you more instructions than that as this is a questionable area, but the files listed above are officially provided â€“ the only change is repacking to a ZIP file as the original executables no longer work on modern computers if you don't have special tools.
