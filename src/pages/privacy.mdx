This site has no cookie consent dialog. Why? Because we do not do anything on this site that would harm your privacy according to the laws effective within the European Union. We don't even have third-party statistics scripts to track visitors. There are "privacy first" options available on the market these days, but is it really private if it is possible to know whether you are a returning visitor or not?

We use no external resources on this site. There are embedded YouTube videos, but all instances use `www.youtube-nocookie.com` variant.

On social media we prefer federated uncentralized services such as Mastodon over the commercial providers. We also provide RSS feed which lets you know when there is something new. There is no way to do commercial use of RSS, which makes it great. You should consider using RSS as an alternate for your news and other current topic needs.

In future we will likely have features that make use of cookies. However these features will require a login and thus consent is an obvious part of using that part of the service. No need for a cookie dialog. Additionally we will not implement easy-to-use third party logins based on OAuth which could break privacy.

> A cookie consent dialog is only required on a site if somebody wants to share your information to a third party. We have no such desires.

This site is served globally from international servers all around the world. This means you might access pages of this site from a server that is outside the European Union. However the main database will always locate within the EU.
