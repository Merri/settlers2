The 1990s was the era of 8-bit graphics. It imposed artistic limitations, but also provided some technical possibilities
for neat effects that were lightweight for a computer to handle. Efficient processing was a must at that time as
processing power was much weaker compared to computers of today. These days we have had a revolution in the gaming scene
and we have seen pixel art becoming a popular medium to stylize games. Even if there is no longer a need to do that for
computational reasons.

Here we don't look into a modern title, but an actual 90s game title The Settlers 2, and how it handles it's graphics.
We focus on the 256 color palette and the beautiful lighting and shadow effects which the game creates despite only
having so few colors available. And besides learning how it works, we look into how you can change the palette and still
not break the light and shadow!

## Learning to byte

As this is my first actual blog article here attempting to teach the game internals I will bother you with some general
technical know-how which will be necessary to understand the further we delve into this topic. Feel free to skip to next
section if you're familiar with bits and hexadecimals!

8-bit is equivalent of one byte, and it can represent 256 different values. There are multiple different ways to
represent these values: binary (base 2), hexadecimal (base 16), and the familiar base 10 decimal system. Each of the
examples below represent the same numerical value:

-   Base 10 number: `11`
-   Base 2 as binary: `00001011`
-   Base 16 as hex: `0x0B`

Here binary visually displays all the 8 bits and it is a common way to show binary. The least important bit is to the
right. It is value of 1. Every bit further to the left is a power of 2 of the previous bit. Thus: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,
64, 128. That is what the values are up to a full single byte with 8 bits. Binary is a base of 2 it only has two numbers
available, 0 and 1. This makes for a simple logic to understand the numbers: value 0 means a bit is not active, while
value 1 means it is active.

In the above example we have bits 1, 2, and 8 active as indicated by number 1. When we combine these bits together we
can do math: 1 + 2 + 8 = 11. That is how binary can be translated to our familiar numeric system.

Hexadecimal instead is base 16. We represent it with the familiar numbers, but we also extend it with 6 more from the
alphabet: A, B, C, D, E and F. Hexadecimals are used because they are a rather convenient way to display byte
information: you only need two digits to show a byte. The same explained in math: 16 &times; 16 = 256, the number of
different values (or states) a byte can hold.

The example value above is `0B`. When we start translating the alphabets to the familiar system we first react `A`. It
is 10. The next digit is `B`, which is 11. Which means the last hexadecimal letter `F` is equivalent of 15.

What about the maximum value of a byte? What does it look like?

-   Base 10: `255`
-   Base 2: `11111111`
-   Base 16: `0xFF`

> **Note!**<br />`0x` does nothing: it is only a common syntax for humans to let you know the number is hexadecimal.

The important thing to understand is that these different systems make it **easier** to grasp computer concepts and
data. For example things like bitflags and bitmasks start to make much more sense once you have an understanding of
binary and hexadecimal. Also, understanding what makes up a byte is quite important as it's ability to contain 256
different values directly explains why an 8-bit indexed palette has 256 colors.

If you find these concepts difficult to grasp I highly recommend looking up a more comprehensive article on the topic!

## The basics of 8-bit palettes

There are a **lot** of image and palette file formats. An issue with palette file formats is that many of them share the
same file extension: `PAL`. It can be a Jasc Software Palette, a RIFF Palette (= Microsoft Windows LogPalette), an
Enchanced RIFF Palette, or a raw binary palette of byte values in either 24-bit or 16-bit format. The 24-bit binary
palette is also known as VGA palette, or as Adobe Color Table with `ACT` file extension.

24-bit VGA palette is a simple format in that it has all the 256 palette entries in order making up to a file that is
always 768 bytes in size. Why that size? Each color consist of three bytes: red, green, and blue. Thus 256 colors nets
in 768 bytes. This is also where the 24-bit comes from: 3 bytes = 3 &times; 8 bits = 24 bits. 24-bit colors means that
a palette can choose from to 256 &times; 256; &times; 256 different colors, or about 1.67 million colors.

> **Note!**<br />Adobe Color Table may have an additional footer and then it is 772 bytes. The final 2 bytes is a 16-bit value telling how many of the colors there are. You can find both 768 bytes and 772 bytes sized files using `ACT` file extension in circulation.

This 768 bytes color table also happens to be a common way to store palettes in image files. For example on 8-bit `GIF`
images the palette is in that raw binary format and can be manipulated directly using a hex editor &ndash; of course as
long as you know where the palette is located!

However The Settlers II does not use a file format that is common these days. Instead it uses an Amiga standard known as
Interchange File Format, `IFF`. You can't find this file extension however. Instead within the graphics directory you
can find `BBM` and `LBM` extensions. This extension is used for both `ILBM` and `PBM` format images, which are subtypes
of images standardized for the IFF.

The lucky part is that IFF is a relatively easy format to read even in a hex editor. And, palettes are also stored in an
entry that is 768 bytes long! But before we get into that: how can you actually see the palette?

## Finding the palettes

Our next goal would be to find and then edit the palettes, so it would be nice to view them! Here we get into our first
struggle: an issue with old file formats is that usually you don't have anything on your system that is able to open the
files!

For our purposes there are mostly nine interesting files, in three locations. These locations are `DATA\TEXTURES`,
`GFX\PALETTE` and `GFX\TEXTURES`. The last location is best for actually seeing some image, however it is a file which
provides no value to us as far as editing a palette goes. However to get started we will ignore the other paths for now.
Lets see how we could open `TEX5.LBM`!

For purely viewing the game's images there are many options available. A cross-platform tool for about any common device
would be <Link href="https://www.xnview.com/en/">XnView</Link>. For Windows you might
like <Link href="https://www.irfanview.com/">IrfanView</Link> although you will also need to install the plugins
package to get ILBM support. You can also use these programs to convert images, however they likely do not support the
specific format used by The Settlers II, so you can only do reliable conversions **from** S2 files, not **to** S2.

<figure style="text-align: center;">
	<img

	/>
	<figcaption
		children={

				IrfanView can display <code>TEX5.LBM</code>, but it handles it as 24 bits image (24 BPP).
				<br />
				To gain access to the app's palette editor it should handle it as 8 BPP.
			</>
		}
	/>
</figure>

But there is another problem: these programs do not help with palettes! What we want to do is to be able to see the
palette colors and their RGB values. This limits options a lot and personally as a Windows user I've long
found <Link href="https://bluebyte.settlers2.net/utils">Paint Shop Pro 7</Link> to be useful. It is actually still my
daily driver graphics program after over 22 years since it's release as I rarely have needs for fancier functionality
than what PSP7 provides.

For the rest of this article I will use PSP7 to demonstrate. You can also use other program that you prefer and know to
support indexed palettes, however finding a suitable converter that keeps the indexed palette intact and untouched can
be a challenge. One potential possibility that I found while researching this article
was <Link href="https://netpbm.sourceforge.net/">Netpbm</Link> which is a command line image conversion utility
available for multiple operating systems.

## Viewing the palette

By this point we should know a program that can open an LBM image file and handle it as indexed palette file, meaning
that we also can view and edit it's palette in the image editor. Here is what `TEX5.LBM` looks like when opened up in
Paint Shop Pro 7:

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img
		alt="Paint Shop Pro 7 with TEX5.LBM open and palette visible"
		src="/assets/articles/2023-07-30_psp7-tex5-lbm.png"
		width="666"
		height="601"
		loading="lazy"
	/>
</p>

PSP7 is convenient in that we can immediately spot the palette visible on the right side edge of the window! However
being compact the representation isn't the clearest. We can get a better view by opening the palette editor. So via the
top menu we can select `Colors > Edit palette`. What do we see now?

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img
		alt="Edit palette view in Paint Shop Pro 7 using TEX5.LBM file"
		src="/assets/articles/2023-07-30_psp7-tex5-lbm-edit-palette.png"
		width="403"
		height="402"
		loading="lazy"
	/>
</p>

Wonderful! This is what we want to see. By analyzing here we can find the actual color values and write down a few of
them so that we can validate our findings. PSP7 conveniently displays the HTML hex values in the bottom right corner of
this window. In hexadecimal the first three colors are:

`00 00 00 FF FF 00 FF DB 17`

And the last three:

`FF FF FF 00 43 5B 9F A3 9F`

With this information we could now proceed to investigate `TEX5.LBM` with a hex editor to find a 768 bytes region where
the first and last nine bytes match the above values. That would be rather guaranteed to be the location of the palette!

However there is still one thing to note: `TEX5.LBM` isn't actually the file we are interested of. The game **does not**
use the palette in this file in any way. And the palette is also "incorrect" as it does not match exactly with what is
used in the game. In a way, the palette and colors here don't matter, what matters are **the indexed color values of the
image**.

Of course it helps if the colors in the texture file are close to the correct ones, the ones of the actual palette. But
in other words this means that **we can change a palette file without touching these texture files**.

Now how do we do that?

## Editing the palette

I do not know why the palette has been abstracted to it's own file. Maybe it has been considered worthwhile to keep it
as the "master" source so that nobody would accidentally change the master palette of the game while working on the
textures. Or maybe the other tools used for game graphics and sprites required it to be an another small file. Or maybe
the palette rotation rules included in the palette were annoying.

Regardless lets open `PAL5.BBM` and see what we got there!

> **Note!**<br />Before continuing make sure you have backup copies of the game's files. Duplicate the whole game folder, or make a copy of `PAL5.BBM` as `PAL5-original.BBM` or similar. Or maybe make the whole thing a Git repo if you're familiar with git.

<p style="text-align: center;">

		width="773"
		height="752"
		loading="lazy"
	/>
</p>

The image in `PAL5.BBM` is a rather boring one: it is just 8 &times; 8 pixel white block. In the above screenshot I have
zoomed in to the maximum 32x supported by PSP7, which happens to make it exactly the same size as `TEX5.LBM`.

I have also opened the palette again and this time around we do have the actual game palette which you experience when
you are playing a Greenland map. I guess now it is as good time as any to let you know what the special palette indexes
are!

In this palette the first color is black `00 00 00`. This black is not really rendered by the game: it is used for
transparency. When you look at `TEX5.LBM` textures you notice that there are some road and other graphics pieces that
have black color. That black is never rendered.

Here is a table for the rest of the special colors:

<div data-scrolling="inline">

|           Index |  Hex RGB   | Description                                                                  |
| --------------: | :--------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|               0 | `00 00 00` | Transparent / invisible. However some UI elements may also use this.         |
|              57 | `C3 23 23` | Minimap lava color.                                                          |
|              61 | `13 3B A7` | Minimap water color.                                                         |
| 128 &ndash; 155 |     -      | Player colors, 4 colors per player. Total of 7 players.                      |
| 156 &ndash; 159 |     -      | Unused "eighth player". Could repurpose colors for other use.                |
| 250 &ndash; 247 |     -      | Eight colors for water palette rotation.                                     |
| 248 &ndash; 251 |     -      | Four colors for lava and fire palette rotation.                              |
|             252 | `00 00 00` | Black.                                                                       |
|             253 | `FF FF FF` | White.                                                                       |
|             254 | `FF 00 8F` | Most likely a debug color. One of the unused textures is only of this color. |
|             255 | `FF FF FF` | White, unknown if has other meanings.                                        |

</div>

The remaining colors are gradients of varying sizes. Some gradients are evem rather close to each other like neutral
grey, warm grey, cold grey, and an earthy green grey. This variety of greys can help in bringing other colors together.
Also the palette is earth tone heavy with a wide variety of green and brown tones.

The tricky part with these colors is that they are shared with **all visual components** in the game. For the most part
this means editing the colors should be relative: for example if you change one brown color to a purpler tone, you need
to balance out it relative to all other browns as well, and possibly to all the other gradients. This will allow the
game graphics to remain balanced.

Doing that kind of change is hard! For the sake of an example, just to get **something** done, we should do a simple
change that is as unlikely to break anything else as possible. What could we do?

I would suggest to change the player color. This color should not have been used in any texture so it should be fairly
safe bet to change. Lets do that!

To change the colors we need to edit the color values in index 128, 129, 130 and 131. What you want to use is up to you,
but inspired by the debug color I ended up using the following color values:

-   `#FF7DC7`
-   `#F00088`
-   `#B40066`
-   `#8C004F`

These roughly match the original blues in their strength. Now lets proceed to save the file. In Paint Shop Pro 7 we can
actually just go ahead and save this file, because the palette part of the IFF is the same regardless of image subtype
being used. So even if the game would see the palette file's image as garbage due to PSP7 not saving that in the correct
format, the palette instead will be fine!

When saving the file make sure the file format remains as Amiga IFF, and that you do actually save it as `PAL5.BBM`, not
as `PAL5.IFF` or `PAL5.BBM.IFF`.

It is time to boot up the game and see what we've got...

<p style="text-align: center;">

**Success!** If you want to try this file out you can download it here: <a href="/assets/article/2023-07-30_debug-player.zip">2023-07-30_debug-player.zip</a>.

If you are using something else than Paint Shop Pro 7 then you might need to do additional steps to get the final BBM
file:

1. Save the image as indexed palette 8-bit PNG. Make sure when saving that no optimization settings are enabled!
2. Use a tool to convert from PNG to LBM. Subtype doesn't really matter, it can be either ILBM or PBM.
3. Rename the resulting file as `PAL5.BBM` and put it inside `GFX\PALETTE` to replace the original file.

Similarly you may need to actually do the same in reverse, to convert the `PAL5.BBM` to a PNG file. Again, when
converting you must make sure there are no extra optimizations applied, and that the resulting file is 8-bit indexed
palette file with 256 colors. Optimizations are dangerous as they tend to touch the palette and mess things up.
Optimizations are great for web, but not great when you want to maintain correctness of data for a game.

## Viewing the light and shadow color table

We have now covered the files within `GFX` directory, but how about that `DATA\TEXTURES` directory? What are those
`GOU5.DAT` and others doing?

By inspecting the files we notice one thing: they all share a size being 65536 bytes, or 64 kilobytes. Whoa, entire
memory capacity of a Commodore 64! Purely looking at the file via hex editor won't make you any wiser: the values seem
utter garbage.

Until at one point you notice that the file runs through entire range of byte values in order. All the way from `0x00`
to `0xFF`. That is faschinating, and it is a clue. Since the file is related to textures, what would happen if we looked
into this file by using a palette?

There is of course a challenge: most image programs don't let you open a raw image stream. Luckily again, at least for
me, Paint Shop Pro 7 happens to support this! So browse to `DATA\TEXTURES` using PSP7, pick Raw file format and then
open up `GOU5.DAT`. You will be presented with a dialog:

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img
		alt="Paint Shop Pro 7 RAW Options dialog"
		src="/assets/articles/2023-07-30_psp7-gou5-dat-raw-options.png"
		width="287"
		height="372"
		loading="lazy"
	/>
</p>

Wait wait wait! The width and height are empty, how did I know to enter 256 in both fields? This information is derived
from the range of a byte, again. Also when you do 256 &times; 256 you get the file's size, 65536.

All the other fields can remain untouched. What happens after clicking OK?

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img
		alt="GOU5.DAT"
		src="/assets/articles/2023-07-30_gou5-dat.png"
		width="768"
		height="768"
		loading="lazy"
		style="image-rendering: pixelated;"
	/>
</p>

I made the image bigger to make it a bit easier to see what is going on. What is interesting is the row 64 (`0x40`).
That is the line where the values increase in order from 0 to 255, or from black to white when represented in a
greyscale palette.

However, the rest of the image still doesn't really make a lot of sense. So, we now need to get a palette to this image.
Go back to `PAL5.BBM` (the original one) and save the palette. In PSP7 this happens via `Colors > Save palette`. Once
this is done make `GOU5.DAT` image active and the do the reverse, `Colors > Load palette`. PSP7 will notify about the
image getting converted to indexed image. This is what we want. Continue on!

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img
		alt="Paint Shop Pro 7 Load paletet dialog: maintain indexes active"
		src="/assets/articles/2023-07-30_psp7-gou5-dat-load-palette-maintain-indexes.png"
		width="422"
		height="390"
		loading="lazy"
	/>
</p>

At this point is is very important that you choose **Maintain indexes** from the bottom. Then pick up the palette you
saved and open it.

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img
		alt="GOU5.DAT with a palette"
		src="/assets/articles/2023-07-30_gou5-dat-palette.png"
		width="768"
		height="768"
		loading="lazy"
		style="image-rendering: pixelated;"
	/>
</p>

Oh! Now this makes much more sense! We can clearly see how each color of the palette has been applied more darkness as
color goes up from row 64, while becoming lighter as color goes further down. And the best thing is: we can also modify
this file!

A simple trick that you can do is to invert the image from the top 130 rows. So I did that and saved the file again
still keeping it as a RAW image. The palette / color data does not matter as it wont be saved. What will be saved are
the index values of the palette.

After saving the file as `GOU5.DAT` (despite using Raw file format) it is time to boot up the game and check the result:

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<img
		alt="Light and shadow inverted on The Settlers II Gold Edition"
		src="/assets/articles/2023-07-30_inverted-shadow-and-light.png"
		width="1024"
		height="768"
		loading="lazy"
	/>
</p>

And it worked! While this reversal of shadow and light isn't a useful modification as such we see that we now have some
control over the light and shadow. We could do things such as adjust the strength of the light and shadow, make it
either less or more strong. As long as the indexes do match with the palette defined in `PAL5.BBM` you can do whatever
changes you please. Like, maybe have set of palette colors dedicated for ice texture that becomes ultra glossy, while
rest of the colors are more toned down.

## A useful palette utility

There is one more thing I wish to talk about with you. I have made a small little project over at CodeSandbox that can
handle reading lots of palette and indexed image file formats. There is a cool thing you can do with it: you can drop in
an image file over a palette, and that image will be converted to use that palette using closest colors possible.

In other words: it is **ideal** for making the final `GOU5.DAT` images! You can work in full color mode when adjusting
your light and shadow on each color and then drop the image on the palette opened in the palette project and copy back
the resulting image.

You can find the utility here: <Link href="https://codesandbox.io/s/indexed-palette-converter-xw113">Indexed Palette Converter</Link>

Note that the code is not super optimized: if you drop a huge file on a palette, especially something like a JPEG, it
will take almost forever to process it. The tool is much more optimal for switching images between palettes.

## Wrapping up

In this article you should've learned a few things:

-   Why bytes and their visual reprentations are crucial to understand
-   What 8-bit VGA palettes are
-   What are indexed images and how their data relates to a palette
-   How you can change a palette in The Settlers 2 despite it's exotic file format
-   That you can view and change the game's light and shadow table
