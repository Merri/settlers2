You can now find <a href="https://bluebyte.settlers2.net">bluebyte.settlers2.net</a> which contains archived copies of
Settlers I, Settlers II, and Settlers III files from Blue Byte FTP which was taken down quite a few years ago by now.
These are different to the previous copies available on this site, which are conversions from EXE to ZIP archives.

In addition I uploaded any unique(ish) original copies of Settlers II demos that I could find from my own archives, and
also got a few more from Hallfiry, including French and Polish demos!

Finally, I also uploaded copies of map files that I found from my archives. Most of these are not really unique in that
they can still be found by digging the known fan sites, but at least there is a backup now. Still haven't gotten around
to creating the maps database.

## Other updates

I didn't only put up BlueByte Archives site, I have also updated <a href="/download">Downloads page</a> with more info,
and the file listing on <a href="/documentation">Tech Docs page</a> has been improved.

And then there is also the big one: <a href="/documentation/map-files">a new map files documentation</a>! Especially the
part on textures has been greatly expanded compared to the older WLD/SWD documentation.
