Welcome to the new revamped site!

The last time I worked on the site some two years ago I moved to an early version of <Link href="https://astro.build">Astro</Link>. Since then the framework has come a long way and is now packed with much more features than it had when I first converted the site from WordPress.

Things are quite different this time: instead of having a quick and dirty "just make it work" type of conversion the site has much more care put into it. The content has now been split into multiple sections: Blog, Guides, Downloads, Utilities, and Tech Docs. I hope this brings much more clarity on the available content that was mostly written a long time ago, and then just organically put whereever it seemed to fit at a time.

The new front page is also an attempt to serve people who might not even have ever heard about the game before. As a neat little bonus the new design now supports light and dark themes! The control for that is currently at the bottom of the page.

There is also new content on the site which I hope you like to check out. Some of it is still to be written. I hope I get to finish them in the near future.
