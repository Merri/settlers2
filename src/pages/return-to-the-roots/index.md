Return to the Roots or **RttR** is an **open source** add-on type of remake of The Settlers II. This means it requires the original game files in order to work as Ubisoft did not give Settlers Freaks (the group developing RttR) a permission to redistribute the files. This means you need The Settlers II: Gold Edition for RttR to work.

Return to the Roots supports multiple operating systems, being playable on Windows 10, 7, Vista & XP as well as Mac OS X and Linux. RttR adds a few features from limiting the total amount of catapults a player can build to fully working Internet multiplayer. Playing in Internet Lobby requires you to register at [RttR forums](https://www.rttr.info/ "The Settlers II"), but you can also setup Direct IP games. AI is also in development, but the main attraction is the multiplayer.
