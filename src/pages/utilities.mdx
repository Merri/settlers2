These are utilities in various stages of development. They are a part of this site with the source code freely available
on <Link href="https://github.com/Merri/settlers">GitHub</Link>.

## Map Generator

You can use The Settlers II.net Map Generator to create fully playable random maps. This map generator is less strict on
it's limitations, you can use it as an experimental creative tool to help in making nice maps.

This also means the generated maps are unbalanced with the resources they provide which makes them less ideal for
(competitive) multiplayer as some players will have a natural advantage.

## World Editor

This small utility let's you cut pieces of maps, enlarge map area, and do other various kinds of manipulation. You can
also use it to fix and sanitize and map file to make it work better with the original The Settlers II. For example, if
you have made a map with Return to the Roots map editor or random map generator you can give that file to World Editor,
and download it again to make it as compatible with the original game as possible.

Another feature is that you can drop your saved games or even the pre-1.51 versions of the map files into the editor and
save them in a version 1.51 compatible format.

## Text Utility

You can use this tool to translate the game's `ENG` or `GER` text files, the ones you can't open in a regular text
editor. You can also create freshly new text files for your own campaign missions.

This text utility has a high level of error correction and can open files that are known to be slightly broken, and upon
saving will fix to the format expected by the original game.
