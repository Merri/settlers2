<Link href="http://www.michelepirovano.com/dotage/">Dot Age (.Age)</Link> is a village simulator that combines itself with
a roguelike. It doesn't really look or feel like a Settlers game, but it has some similarities:

1. You build things
2. You gather resources
3. People do their things

Everything else is quite different. Dot Age is turn based and does not have a competing player. Your enemy is the nature: diseases and events will throw the challenge at you. Also, it is a bit funny when you game over to mass diarrhea.

The game has been <Link href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=476494800">greenlighted on Steam a month ago</Link> and the dev is aiming for end of the year release.
