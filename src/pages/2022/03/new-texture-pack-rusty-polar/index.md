Does Wasteland bother you by being dark and dull? Is Winter World nice but maybe **too** white? Now you have an option!
The new **Rusty Polar** texture pack let's you experience the game in new beautiful environments: **Rusty Valley** and
**Polar Night**.

**Rusty Valley** replaces old underground lava Wasteland with a new dry, sandy, warm toned desert wasteland.

**Polar Night** replaces "grow grain fields on snow" Winter World by introducing grass fields to the available textures,
and being inspired by the moment when sun is past the horizon and sky is turning purple and pink indicating that cold
will come.

### Release Candidate 1

This is the first release candidate. In RC phase things are mostly set in stone, but some time will be allowed to pass
so that possible bugs are found and can be fixed before claiming the pack as "final".

However for final release I would like to provide the textures with **new maps** that make use of the changed textures.
While the new textures look mostly nice on old maps (and make them look totally different!) the new set of style allow
doing new visual combinations that you wouldn't have done with the original Wasteland and Winter World. At the moment
I'm thinking about having three maps for each texture set, so six maps in total. These maps could be small, medium, and
large in size. Let me know if you're interested in making the maps that get to be part of the final release!

### I want it now!

Compatible with The Settlers II Gold Edition. Return to the Roots will need some adjustments due to graphical glithes
which will be fixed in a future release.
