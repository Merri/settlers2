Each setting on this page is followed by **numeric parameters** (except for `!ENABLE_ALL_HOUSES`).

The documentation is incomplete. Why not contribute? [You can do so via GitHub](https://github.com/Merri/settlers2)!

    Sets active map (200 to 209)

- **`!GLOBAL_SET_BOBS #`**
    
    Sets which `MIS_#_BOBS.LST` file to use for special mission only graphics (0 to 5)
    
    [![MISBOBS.LST](/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/MISBOBS.png "MIS0BOBS, MIS1BOBS, MIS2BOBS, MIS3BOBS, MIS4BOBS, MIS5BOBS")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/MISBOBS.png)_

    Disallows AI players to build buildings within that area.
    
    Numeric parameters are as follows:

    1. Radius Should be atleast 10 or more. Otherwise AI might build a fortress right at the edge thus claiming the land covered by the barrier anyway.
    2. X location of barrier on the map.
    3. Y location of barrier on the map.

- **`!GLOBAL_SET_COMPUTER_ALLIANCE # #`**

    Sets alliance between ALL players (not only between computer players).

## `[MAPCOMMANDS]`

- **!SET_HOUSE # # #**<br />Adds a building (ie. 24 = headquarters) to specified X & Y position.
- **!ENABLE_HOUSE #**<br />Allows currently active player to build given building type.
- **!ENABLE_ALL_HOUSES**<br />Allows building all building types.
- **!DISABLE_HOUSE #**<br />Removes building type from being available to build.
- **!ADD_WARE # #**<br />Sets resource's amount for active player. The first value is a type ID that ranges from 0 to 30.
- **!ADD_PEOPLE # #**<br />Like resources but with worker types. The type ID values range from 0 to 29 where last five values set the amount of soldiers of each type.
- **!SET_ACT_PLAYER #**<br />Changes the active player for which the above rules apply. When this is not yet given the rules apply to human player (player 0).
- **!ADD_ANIMAL # # #**<br />Adds animal (0 to 9) to given X & Y location.

### Scripted mission events

- `!MET_DIRECT_EVENT`
- `!MET_HOUSE_ENABLING`
- `!MET_POSITION_EXPLORED`
- `!MET_POSITION_OCCUPIED`
- `!MET_END_EVENT`
- `!MET_SET_FINAL_EVENT`
- `!MET_SET_MAP_ELEMENT`
- `!MET_ADD_AS_ACT_EVENT`

## `[ENDE]`

This is an optional end of file, sometimes with an additional `0x1A` as the last character of the file. If you wish to type it you can push `ALT + 0026` (using numbers on the numpad). However since this is optional the file will work fine without.
