The Settlers II features multiple variations of map files. In each version of the game you have two formats: the "raw"
map files with no saved data, and saved games. The shared parts of these two formats are mostly compatible with each
other, however regular maps cannot include saved game data when being loaded as a starting point for a new map as some
crucial information would be missing which is set into additional files when a map is a saved game.

## Veni Vidi Vici releases

This includes versions 0.15, 0.16, 1.00, 1.01, and 1.02 of the game. Each beta and demo was setup with the following
files:

```
DATA\MAPS\CONTI200.DAT
DATA\MAPS\WORLD200.DAT
DATA\MISSIONS\MIS_0000.RTX
DATA\TXT\MISS_001.ENG or DATA\TXT\MISS_001.GER
SAVE\CNTRL800.DAT
SAVE\COMPY800.DAT
SAVE\CONTI800.DAT
SAVE\DESKT800.DAT
SAVE\MAILS800.DAT
SAVE\TRANS800.DAT
SAVE\WORLD800.DAT
```

The beta and demo executables load the 800 variant through their added option to start a demo, while WORLD200.DAT is
usually the first Roman Campaign mission, "Off we go!". Saved games use 900 variant so they are WORLD900.DAT etc. within
the `SAVE` directory.

Put other way, the missions exclusive to the beta/demo version are saved games. This means you can create a saved game
in a later version of the game with any map you desire, and then copy and rename those files to the beta/demo versions
and see what happens. Of course you will not have success porting Winter World to pre-1.51 versions of the game as that
terrain set was introduced in V1.50, however Wasteland might work. There are texture differences in the early versions
especially with Wasteland.

As of writing this I have not done this experimentation and there can be blockers, for example there is less data in
some of the earlier beta/demo version saved games.

### Save game documentation

The saved games appear to be direct memory dumps of the game's internal organization of data, and if you have the
know-how you can probably inspect the data in real time from computer memory and see it being organized exactly as in
the saved game files. For now you can take this claim as "an educated guess" and a pinch of salt as this is something
that has not been verified.

-   [`CONTI###.DAT`](./map-files/CONTI.DAT)
-   [`WORLD###.DAT`](./map-files/WORLD.DAT)

`COMPY###.DAT`, `DESKT###.DAT`, `MAILS###.DAT` and `TRANS###.DAT` to be analyzed.

## Version 1.51

The final version of the game was released first as Mission CD (<span lang="de">Mission Disk</span>) and later as a Gold
Edition with no gameplay changes.

This version of the game introduced a Map Editor `S2EDIT.EXE` which used `WORLD` directory as a target for SWD files.
During this change the old `DATA\MAPS` files were also converted to the new format however their extension was WLD, thus
`MISS_200.WLD`. As a file format there is no real difference between WLD and SWD, they are the same thing.

The WLD/SWD file format combines the old `CONTI###.DAT` and `WORLD###.DAT` files together and adds in an additional
header, and has an optional footer for animal data.

The game does have a difference in how it handles Roman Campaign, World Campaign, and Unlimited Play / Skirmish loading.
Harbor building is enabled only when loading Roman Campaign maps. World Campaign is unique in that it uses leader data
from the map files, although despite there being an option for it you cannot change player from being Octavianus.

In other words, the included header and footer data are used as meta information during loading of WLD/SWD to initialize
a saved game.
