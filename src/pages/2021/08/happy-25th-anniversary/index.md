Many other games have much more successful following and communities, yet **Return to the Roots** has kept on continuing the legacy of the game while expanding upon it by online multiplayer, new features, and new content.

Of course **The Settlers II 10th Anniversary** was released some 15 years ago, but in retrospective it failed to catch the charm of the original game, and followed the original game too soon after while being incompatible. In recent years we've seen many more remakes from the same era which have been more successful, such as **Command & Conquer Remastered** and **Final Fantasy VII Remake**. Of course these games were much more popular back in the day, too.

What will the upcoming years bring? It is hard to say. We know we still have people interested about the game, especially in Germany. And even this site gets the occasional update!
