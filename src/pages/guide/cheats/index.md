The code to activate cheats is `WINTER` (or `THUNDER` in versions earlier than 1.51). You can type this anytime to turn cheats on/off. When you have cheats on you can see an icon with exclamation in the top right corner of the screen:

[![THUNDER cheat in DEMO version 1.02](/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DEMO_Thunder_Cheat.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DEMO_Thunder_Cheat.png)

The cheat enables you to build any building during campaign games. You can also build free headquarters outside your borders, just hit any free space that could hold a building (only works in Gold Edition & Mission CD!). In campaign games it acts just like a new empty storehouse, but on unlimited play you get the same merchandise as when starting the game.

By hitting F7 in the cheat mode you can view the whole map. The speed can also be changed more efficiently: ALT + 1 ... ALT + 6 will set the game speed where higher value means more speed.

## Enable all Roman Campaign missions

Remember to make a backup before editing to avoid the need to reinstall your game!

- Open `SAVE\MISSION.DAT` with a text editor
- Replace contents with `1111111111`
- Or to reset back to normal: `1100000000`

## Enable all World Campaign missions

Remember to make a backup before editing to avoid the need to reinstall your game!

- Open `SAVE\MISSION2.DAT` with a hex editor
- Replace all bytes with hex `01`
- For text editor you can also try copying this: <input type="text" size="40" value="" readonly />

## Modding (or advanced cheating)

Have a look at the documentation menu link at the top. Hex editor is a requirement for most stuff. Personally I recommend [HxD](http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/).
