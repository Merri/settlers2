We've switched to Disqus comments. At the moment it seems the old comments don't yet appear, but they should (as I exported them). Hopefully they do.

Other than that I hope the new comments system works better than the native WordPress one.

On real life news I've finally caught myself a developer job. As a result I'm moving to Helsinki soon and generally things are good. I just lack the usual time to do all the stuff I'd like to do :)
