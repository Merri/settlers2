I'm quite exhausted right now. But I've had a lot of fun, although a bit of hard and frustrating time.

Finally after all these years I've done a proper beginning for a new Map Generator!

Open <Link href="https://codepen.io/Merri/full/eLhtp/">Map Generator in Codepen</Link>

It is still in very early stages, but it creates a height map that looks just **awesome**. And it can be customized quite a bit already. So pretty maps, must click for more... One... More... Map!
