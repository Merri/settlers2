I'm quite exhausted right now. But I've had a lot of fun, although a bit of hard and frustrating time.

Finally after all these years I've done a proper beginning for a new Map Generator!

\[codepen\_embed height="268" theme\_id="8075" slug\_hash="eLhtp" default\_tab="result"\]See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/Merri/pen/eLhtp/'>Map Generator for The Settlers II</a> by Vesa Piittinen (<a href='http://codepen.io/Merri'>@Merri</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.\[/codepen\_embed\]

[I recommend opening it on a new page instead of the above!](http://codepen.io/Merri/full/eLhtp/)

It is still in very early stages, but it creates a height map that looks just **awesome**. And it can be customized quite a bit already. So pretty maps, must click for more... One... More... Map!
