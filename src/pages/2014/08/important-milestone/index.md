The map generator now generates maps that are **playable right away in RttR!** Resources, trees and granite are now placed on the map so there is something to play with. Some final touches are still needed to make sure the compatibility with old game is established. In the meanwhile the original Map Editor can be used to load and then save the map and then the map becomes playable in the original game as well!

Once the project can save proper maps that also work on S2 directly with no assistance from an another tool I will put it on GitHub. Hopefully there are developers out there with a passion for better experiences :) There are many things that can be improved and I can't wait to see ideas other than my own that make up a good map generator!
