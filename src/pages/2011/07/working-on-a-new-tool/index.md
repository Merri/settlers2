I did some work on reading Settlers II language files in PHP. I guess I'll eventually come up with an online localization tool. That should make it very easy to translate the game as you can just first translate the game, then download a single file and extract that to the game folder -> game translated.

Nothing to show at this point though, will see if I get this done, and I don't know yet how I manage with user permissions etc.
