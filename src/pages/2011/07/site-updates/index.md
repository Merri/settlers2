There is finally a page about DOSbox! Screenshots included. It doesn't go into depth, but should be a nice quick start. I guess it would still need some more information on how to actually use DOS, it isn't that common knowledge these days.

I also updated some other pages to match the fact there actually is now a DOSbox page and added a cheat screenshot.

I also downloaded FANpaign & 2NDpaign, the fan made campaigns. These are not yet available on the site, but I'm planning on doing something with them. Also, 2NDpaign contained some nice information I'll be sharing here at some point.
