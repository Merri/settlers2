I think I'll need to simplify the existing pages and organize everything again. I guess it would be an idea to add a page for some other downloads as well, such as maps and make it somehow possible to let users post their maps to me or the site. E-mail would be easy, but registrations should be open too.

Other things could include adding technical documentation on the game file formats. Finding this information is becoming increasingly hard, but in the other hand I may not have the time to get it all written up. Some things I still remember from the top of my head, but it would be better to also test. Both maps & creation of custom campaigns should be covered so that is a lot of information.

Will see if I get any requests to do this.
