I've been including a lot of technical documentation about The Settlers II file formats in the cheats page. It now covers BBM, DAT, IDX, LBM, RTX, SWD & WLD files. Some of the documentation is still to be done, but developers and hackers reading this site (that might be you, eh?)Â  may find this information useful. This game is much more moddable than what we've seen being done this far! I can imagine campaign missions that are not purely based on just finding teleport gates, for instance.
