Ever thought the color selection in The Settlers II is too colorful and happy? Don't worry, I now have a solution for your problem!

Now that shouldn't be too happy for anyone!

Copy that file to your S2\\GFX\\PALETTE directory (I suggest you make a backup of original first!) and you have these colors in your game instead :)
