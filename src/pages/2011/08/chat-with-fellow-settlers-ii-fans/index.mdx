Return to the Roots has an active IRC channel. It is easy to join this channel using <Link href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">Freenode Web IRC</Link>: just give a short nickname (no spaces!), type #siedler2.5 as the channel and you're ready to connect!

Here is a link for those of you who already have an IRC client or use <Link href="http://www.mibbit.com/">Mibbit</Link>: [#siedler2.5 @ irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net/siedler2.5)

Note that most speak German on the channel, but English is not forbidden! You can ask questions on both original The Settlers II as well as Return to the Roots. Note that RttR supports multiplayer so you can also ask people for a game!
