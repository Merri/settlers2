In the past few days there has been an ongoing <Link href="http://www.siedler25.org/index.php?com=forum&mod=forum&action=thread&id=750&start=1">English language discussion over at Return to the Roots forum</Link>. This way I've received a good deal of precious information that makes it much easier for me to jump ahead to actual map file generation. However, I am going to do the map upload & download service first. It is the least interesting for me to do, but I understand the importance of a good place to get your maps from - and to put your maps for display :)
