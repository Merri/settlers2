Jon Lund Steffensen started a [Settlers I remake project last year](http://jonls.dk/2010/06/settlers-1-remake/). He has now made the project open source, releasing the code as [Freeserf](http://jonls.dk/freeserf/). The source code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/jonls/freeserf).

Hopefully a few developers finds this project and continues working on it as it looks quite promising for all the nostalgia hungry people out there!
