Jon Lund Steffensen started a <Link href="http://jonls.dk/2010/06/settlers-1-remake/">Settlers I remake project last year</Link>. He has now made the project open source, releasing the code as <Link href="http://jonls.dk/freeserf/">Freeserf</Link>. The source code is available at <Link href="https://github.com/jonls/freeserf">GitHub</Link>.

Hopefully a few developers finds this project and continues working on it as it looks quite promising for all the nostalgia hungry people out there!
