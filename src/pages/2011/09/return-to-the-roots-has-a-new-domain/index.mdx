Originally known as Die Siedler 2.5, now Return to the Roots, has a new short'n'sweet domain: <Link href="http://rttr.info">rttr.info</Link>. This is a good road for the previously closed source German only project, now open source, to become friendly for the international audience :)

A question for all the readers: should RttR have monthly multiplayer activity in a single day? The idea in this is that you'd know for sure that one date when you can certainly find other players to play with, as this may be hard at times. Tell me what you think!
