?>Here you can find demos and DOSbox instructions for running the game on a modern computer, as The Settlers II is a DOS / Win95 era game. There are also other interesting downloads, such as ones that can translate English version of the game to German, French and Finnish!<?php

					<h2>DOSbox</h2>
					<p>These days it is almost necessary to run the game using a DOSbox. It is possible to get the game to work in Windows XP, even with sound by using VDMsound, but DOSbox or other method of emulation is necessary if you are running Windows 7 or Vista, or a 64-bit operating system.</p>
					<p>More information coming later. Written in 2009-09-23.</p>
					<h3>Demo versions</h3>
					<p>All these demo versions and updates have been repacked with a modern self extract compression tool to reduce download size and to support modern versions of Windows properly.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="demo/s2gold.exe">Gold Edition Demo V1.51</a> (English)</li>
						<li><a href="demo/s2demo.exe">Gold Edition Demo V1.51</a> (German)</li>
						<li><a href="demo/s2miss.exe">Mission CD Demo V1.51</a> (English)</li>
						<li><a href="demo/settler2.exe">Veni Vidi Vici Demo V1.02</a> (English)</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Installation</h4>
					<p>Simply extract the game within a folder that you use in DOSbox as a root folder. If you don't have, create one. The folder could be something like <kbd>C:\DOS\</kbd> or <kbd>C:\Games\</kbd>. You must create a new folder for each game, so the final folder could be like <kbd>C:\DOS\S2GOLD\</kbd>.</p>
					<h3>Updates</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="update/s2v151.exe">Veni Vidi Vici to V1.51</a> (English)</li>
						<li><a href="update/s2up151.exe">Veni Vidi Vici to V1.51</a> (German)</li>
						<li><a href="update/s2mup151.exe">Mission CD to V1.51</a> (German)</li>
						<li><a href="update/patch152.exe">Unofficial Patch V1.52</a> (German)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The first downloads are useful if you have the original CD and want to play it without the bugs. Unofficial patch is for the German version of the game and it includes a new texture for greenland, improved ingame help for buildings, new opening screen and fixes "<span xml:lang="de">Gelehrten</span>" (Scholar) to "<span xml:lang="de">Geologen</span>" (Geologist). The texture works with the English &amp; French versions of the game as well, although you may wish to make a backup before you try it out. Personally I think it enhances the background too much by making it darker: I like to have building names visible and this texture makes it nearly impossible to read them.</p>
					<h4>Installation</h4>
					<p>Locate your The Settlers II location and then extract the contents of the downloaded archive into that folder. The folder can be something like <kbd>C:\BLUEBYTE\SETTLER2\</kbd> or <kbd>C:\Program Files\GOG.com\Settlers 2 GOLD\</kbd>.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2 class="language">Language packs</h2>
					<p>The new Gold Edition release in GOG.com is English only, which effectively means there is a need for localized versions. These self extracting downloads help you meet this need. I've also Finnished the game (a quality translation if you ask me).</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="language/s2ger152.exe">Deutsch, German V1.52</a> (from "unofficial patch")</li>
						<li><a href="language/s2eng151.exe">English V1.51</a></li>
						<li><a href="language/s2fre102.exe">Français, French V1.02</a> (works in V1.51, map editor untranslated)</li>
						<li><a href="language/s2fin100.exe">Suomenkielinen, Finnish V1.00</a> (<a href="http://settlers2.merri.net/">lisätietoja suomennoksesta</a>)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>I'm always open for more translations and improvements to the existing ones. Contact me for further information, my Gmail account is <kbd>vesa.piittinen</kbd> or you can go to GOG.com Settlers forum and post in a thread there.</p>
					<h3>Installation</h3>
					<p>I recommend first to make a backup copy of the whole DATA folder just in case something goes wrong. You can find this folder in <kbd>C:\BLUEBYTE\SETTLER2\</kbd>, <kbd>C:\Program Files\GOG.com\Settlers 2 GOLD\</kbd> or whichever path you have installed the game into.</p>
					<p>Once you have made a copy of the DATA folder you can extract the contents of the downloaded archive. Execute the download, browse to the DATA folder and extract files there.</p>

					<h2>Links for more</h2>
					<p>On this site I've left out German tools &amp; cheat programs, because for many they are impossible to use. Yet here you can find links to a few sites that provide these downloads. Official sites are included for reference to original unmodified downloads.</p>
