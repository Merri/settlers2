					<h2 class="mine" id="goldmine"><img alt="" src="goldmine.png" /> Gold mine</h2>
					<p>Gold is an important resource, because it allows you to create coins, which in turn can be used by your soldiers to train and improve their equipment. A <a href="../house/#mint">Mint</a> must be built for coins to be made.</p>
					<p>Requires: bread, fish, ham</p>
					<p>Produces: gold</p>
					<p>Building requires: 4 boards and a miner</p>
					<h2 class="mine" id="ironmine"><img alt="" src="ironmine.png" /> Iron mine</h2>
					<p>Iron ore is required for tools and weapons to be made. Without weapons and <a href="../house/#brewery">beer</a> you can't get more soldiers, without tools you run out of specialized workers and your new houses remain unoccupied because work can't be done without proper tools! <a href="../house/#armory">Armory</a> is the source for weapons while <a href="../house/#metalworks">Metalworks</a> handle the tool policy. However, an <a href="../house/#ironsmelter">Iron smelter</a> is first required to process iron ore to iron.</p>
					<p>Requires: bread, fish, ham</p>
					<p>Produces: iron ore</p>
					<p>Building requires: 4 boards and a miner</p>
					<h2 class="mine" id="coalmine"><img alt="" src="coalmine.png" /> Coal mine</h2>
					<p>Coal is a very important mineral, without it your Armory, Mint and Metalworks are worth nothing! Most often half of your mines must be coal mines.</p>
					<p>Requires: bread, fish, ham</p>
					<p>Produces: coal</p>
					<p>Building requires: 4 boards and a miner</p>
					<h2 class="mine" id="granitemine"><img alt="" src="granitemine.png" /> Granite mine</h2>
					<p>Stones are worthy for construction and as an ammo for <a href="../house/#catapult">Catapults</a>. Unlike <a href="../hut/#stonemason">Stonemason</a>, granite miners require food to do their work just like the other miners. They claim their stone is superior, but this claim is yet to be proven.</p>
					<p>Requires: bread, fish, ham</p>
					<p>Produces: stone</p>
					<p>Building requires: 4 boards and a miner</p>
