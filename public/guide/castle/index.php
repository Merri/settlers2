?>Castles are the biggest and most space consuming buildings, which can't be built anywhere. There is also a special coastal castle: it is the only place where a harbor can be built.<br /><br /><a href="../">Â« Back to the Guide</a><?php

					<h2 class="castle" id="farm"><img alt="" src="farm.png" /> Farm</h2>
					<p>A farmer ensures a steady supply of grain which is required for <a href="../house/#bakery">baking bread</a> and for growing pigs and donkeys. Grain fields are grown two spots away from the farm building so make sure you have enough space around your farms!</p>
					<p>Requires: nothing</p>
					<p>Produces: grain</p>
					<p>Building requires: 3 boards, 3 stones and a farmer (scythe)</p>
					<h2 class="castle" id="pigfarm"><img alt="" src="pigfarm.png" /> Pig farm</h2>
					<p>Meat is an important source of food. The pigs grown here are sent to a <a href="../house/#slaughterhouse">Slaughterhouse</a>.</p>
					<p>Requires: grain, water</p>
					<p>Produces: meat</p>
					<p>Building requires: 3 boards, 3 stones and a pig breeder</p>
					<h2 class="castle" id="donkeybreeder"><img alt="" src="donkeybreeder.png" /> Donkey breeder</h2>
					<p>Every now and then traffic grows on certain roads so that a carrier requires a helper. This is a job for a donkey and to get one, you need to breed &amp; grow one. A donkey easily doubles the tranport capacity of a single road.</p>
					<p>Requires: grain, water</p>
					<p>Produces: donkeys</p>
					<p>Building requires: 3 boards, 3 stones and a donkey breeder</p>
					<h2 class="coastalcastle" id="harbor"><img alt="" src="harbor.png" /> Harbor</h2>
					<p>A harbor is required whenever you wish to spread to other islands. The main function of a harbor is to work as a <a href="../house/#storehouse">storehouse</a>, but an expedition can be started in which case a ship is reserved for harbor's use and the required resources are gathered from elsewhere. Once more harbors are in place they work as a tranportation cluster that ensure transportation of any number of goods around your islands. However, it is most efficient to make each of your islands able to live on their own to reduce the amount of unnecessary traffic.</p>
					<p><img alt="" src="/design/coastal_castle.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;" /> A harbor can only be built on a special coastal castle tile! The icon can be identified by an anchor.</p>
					<p>Requires: boards, stones, a builder</p>
					<p>Produces: expeditions</p>
					<p>Building requires: 4 boards, 6 stones</p>
					<h2 class="castle" id="fortress"><img alt="" src="fortress.png" /> Fortress</h2>
					<p>The strongest of the strong, a fortress protects your most precious buildings and the critical points of your border defence. Attacking a fortress has high risks, but conquering one can be advantageous for a long time. A fortress is also the most efficient place to train your soldiers: a single gold coin can pay for the training of up to four soldiers at a time!</p>
					<p>Requires: gold coins</p>
					<p>Produces: nothing</p>
					<p>Building requires: 4 boards, 7 stones and 9 soldiers</p>
