# The Settlers II docs

Over time this documentation can hopefully explain every single byte in file formats used by the game.

At the moment of writing this we know everything necessary for creating perfect WLD/SWD maps. It is also possible to replace existing graphics in the original game, although there are still no open source tools for doing this; only old commercial software. Most new development happen on Return to the Roots.

Things that require more analyzing and documentation include save game files. Knowing more on this would allow creation of custom campaigns where AI has more existing buildings to give it a head start. Also mission RTX files are not yet fully documented.
